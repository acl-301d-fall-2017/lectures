# Class 19 -  Project Week: Milestone 4

## Presentation Prep

1. Test your presentation:`
 * As your teams now have MVP in place and are focusing more on layout, design, and stretch goals today, take a few minutes at some point to go to the classroom and take a look at your app on the projector/screen setup. You'll be glad you did. It's often a moment of, "THAT'S not what we want it to look like!"

2. Plan your presentation:
    * Please introduce yourself at the beginning of your presentation. A simple "Hi, I'm X" will do. Not everyone in the audience will know your name.
    * Structure your presentation into two sections:
        1. Demo your app (around 10 minutes)
            * **Each person** on the team should demo and talk about one part of the app
            * Show us what your app can do, don't tell us!
            * Don't tell us what your app can't do.
        2. Talk about the tech (10-15 minutes)
            * **Each person** on the team should have a specific topic to talk about. 
            * You can talk about some CSS you wrote, or a function you're proud of, or a challenge you conquered.
            * Do **not** wing this. Have something in mind before presenting and know what you want to say.
            * Showing code is not mandatory, but if you do, don't walk us line by line. 
    * Each team member needs to contribute and talk during each section. You all put a lot of hard into your project and now's the time to talk about what you did and what you learned.

3. Rehearse your presentation:
 * Set a timer and take turns talking through your topics.

4. Get to a good place in your work and deploy! Don't push this off to last minute tomorrow.

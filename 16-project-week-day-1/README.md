## Final Project Rules and Process
For your final project, your task is to work with a team to build a web site that simulates a real-world product, service, or game.

**Rules:**

Your team must adhere to the following requirements.
* There can be no more than 5 people per team.
* Each person must make meaningful contributions in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Your web site must have at least 3 interlinked pages and clear navigation.
* Your web site must have at least 2 pages that accept and process user input.
* Your web site's state must persist between page reloads.
* Your web site must be deployed live on the Internet.

1.  Here are some tips on how to organize your team during the launch phase.

 * Elect a Launch Driver who will be responsible for the following:
    * Driving the coding of the initial scaffolding phase.
    * Hosting the code under their GitHub account (or create a new GitHub organization for your team and an organizational repo for the project)
 * The rest of the team will be Launch Navigators and responsible for the following:
      * Navigating the coding of the initial scaffolding phase.
      * Staying one-step ahead of the Launch Driver by researching unfamiliar technology.
 * Once everyone is in agreement, here's how to launch a new  project.
      * Build a basic file scaffold from scratch **as a team**.
      * Initialize a new git repository (in a personal or organization account).
      * Push it to GitHub and (optional) [add your team members as Collaborators](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/).
      * Deploy it to Heroku and (optional) [add your team members as Collaborators](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/sharing).

Make a plan, and get to work!

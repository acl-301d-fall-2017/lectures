Submitting your Labs 
===

## Basic steps for all assignments

1. Fork the lab's repository _to your own github account_
1. Clone your forked repo locally (`git clone ...`)
1. Start a branch (`git checkout -b dev`)   
1. Repeat until done:
    * Do work
      * Complete 1-3 related tasks
      * Commit
    * Repeat
    * Push to your github fork
    * Repeat
    
1. Submit a PR from `<your fork>/<your branch>` to `<class repo>/<branch-with-your-github-username>`
    * Your PR description in GH should read like: 	**sajoy**  wants to merge 3 commits into `01-mobile-first:sajoy` from `sajoy:dev`
1. **In Canvas** submit the PR url AND answers to the following:
    1. How long did you spend on this assignment?
